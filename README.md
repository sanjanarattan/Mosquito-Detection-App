- Began learning about deep learning with TensorFlow and the pre-existing resnet-50 model
- Created mos database, decided to add for now butterflies and will expand later
- Trained model (took 2 hours -_-)

- Model can now differentiate between butterflies and mosquitos, and between the three main mosquito species (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex)
- Retrained model to increase accuracy (took so long)
- Will begin working on application with Flutter
    - Goal: Learn Flutter Basics and design a few small applications
